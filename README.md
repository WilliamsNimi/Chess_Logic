# Chess_Logic (Work in Progress)

 An attempt to build the logical moves of all the chess pieces usng cartesian coordinates to represent the board
 
 The board is labelled like an 8x8 grid on the cartesian plane, starting at (0,0), with Square a1 being (0,0), and square h8 being (7,7).
 
 Pieces are denoted using the first letter of their color name (W or B), the side of the board they fall on (K or Q), and the first letter of their name (R,N,B). 
 
 The king and Queen are WQ, WK or BQ, BK. The pawns are labelled using the first letter of their color name (W or B) with the letter p, then their number starting from the 1 to 8, from the left of each player if it were an over the board game. 
 
 The game is played using chess algebraic notation to denote where each piece is to move to. The User selects a piece by typing the exact name of the piece as seen on the board. For example, the a2 pawn will be Wp1. Assuming it wants to move to a3, the move location will be a3.
